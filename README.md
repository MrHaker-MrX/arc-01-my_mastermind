## Welcome to my_mastermind

Welcome to my_mastermind, a simple Mastermind game implemented in C.

## Task

Your task is to provide a comprehensive README file for the my_mastermind project. The README should contain all the necessary information for users and developers to understand, install, and use the program.

## Description

The my_mastermind project is a command-line implementation of the Mastermind game in C. Mastermind is a classic code-breaking game where the player attempts to guess a secret code within a limited number of attempts.

The program generates a random secret code consisting of four digits from 0 to 8. The player must input their guesses, and the program provides feedback on the correctness of the guesses based on the number of well-placed and missed pieces.

## Installation

To install and run my_mastermind, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:

   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the source code.

3. Compile the program using a C compiler. For example, using gcc:

   ```
   gcc -o my_mastermind my_mastermind.c
   ```

4. Run the compiled executable:

   ```
   ./my_mastermind
   ```

## Usage

Once the program is running, follow these steps to play the game:

1. You will be prompted to guess the secret code. Enter your guess consisting of four digits from 0 to 8.

2. After each guess, the program will provide feedback on the number of well-placed and missed pieces.

3. Continue guessing until you either correctly guess the code or exhaust your attempts.

4. If you correctly guess the code within the allotted attempts, you win the game. Otherwise, you lose.

Additionally, you can customize the number of attempts and provide a specific code using command-line arguments:

- Use the `-t` flag followed by the number of attempts.
- Use the `-c` flag followed by the specific code you want to use.

Example:
```
./my_mastermind -t 12 -c 1234
```

This command sets the number of attempts to 12 and uses the code "1234" as the secret code.

## Conclusion

Enjoy playing Mastermind with my_mastermind! Feel free to explore the code and modify it as needed. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please submit them via GitHub issues.
